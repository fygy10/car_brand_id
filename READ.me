Basic outline of the program:

Summary:

A person to take a picture of a car, upload that picture to the application, a convolutional neural network classifies the car by brand,
and the classification is uploaded to ChatGPT via a prompt that tells the user facts about the brand. This was inspired as part of the wave
of new electric vehicle brands have come on the market. 


main.py: runs the program; contains OpenAI and Flask functionality

aws_s3_download: pull the images from an AWS S3 bucket (used during training only)

brand_data: images used during training

car_id_cnn: the model for identifying the car; consists of importing and normalizing the data, building the model,
            training the model, and predicting on an instance that can be pased to a ChatGPT prompt

template: basic HTML used for Flask




Future Steps:

-find a better dataset and a larger one
-imporporate design elements that can are more user friendly 
-refining and training the model further
